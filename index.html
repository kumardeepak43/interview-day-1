        <h2> Q.1-What id Node.js?
        </h2>
        <pre>

            Node.js is a single-process, single-threaded event driven programming language used to run js code in
            backend environment.Node.js applications are written in javascript and can be run within the node.js 
            runtime on windows,linux etc.
        </pre>
        <h2> Q.2-What is NPM?</h2>
        <pre>

            NPM stands for the node package manager, npm is used for node dependency management.we use npm as
            a server-side node dependency tool
            NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code. Nested 
            dependencies mean that any dependency is again dependent on another dependency 
            NPM: It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.
            It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. Help to manage a project’s
            dependencies. npm is installed with Node automatically.
            NPM: NPM generates a ‘package-lock.json’ file. the package-lock will generate the same node_modules folder
            for different npm versions.
        </pre>
        <h2> Q.3-What are the modules in Node.js?</h2>
        <pre>

            In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the
            basis of their related functionality.
            Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.
            The reason programmers are heavily reliant on modules is because of their re-usability as well as the
            ability to break down a complex piece of code into manageable chunks. Modules are of three types:
            1.Core Modules/Internal modules
            2.Local Modules/Custom modules
            3.Third-party Modules
            1.Core Modules: Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js
            installation.
            These modules can be loaded into the program by using the require function. The require() function will
            return a
            JavaScript type depending on what the particular module returns. ex:- http creates an HTTP server in
            Node.js.
            2.Local Modules: Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created locally in your Node.js
            application.
            Let’s create a simple calculating module that calculates various operations. Another file can use its
            exported
            functionality using the require() function.
            3.Third-party modules: Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package
            Manager(NPM).
            These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally. Some of the popular third-party modules
            are
            mongoose, express, angular, and react.

        <h2> Q.4-Difference between default export and named export.</h2>
        <pre>

    
            1. Named Exports,
            2. Default Exports.
            
           1.Named Exports: Named exports are useful to export several values.
             During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.
             Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file and were
             introduced
             with
             the release of ES2015.
             Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the
             object,
             function or variable that was exported.

           2.Default Exports: Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function, variable. During the
             import,
             we can use any name to import.Exports without a default tag are Named exports. Exports with the default tag
             are
             Default exports.
             default export:- Using Named and Default Exports at the same time: It is possible to use Named and Default
             exports
             in the same file. It means both will be imported in the same file.

        <h2> Q.5- How do you import any module in Node.js?
        </h2>
        <pre>

            Importing functions or modules enhances the reusability of code.
            Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in the imported module in
            another file. The result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions
            using the dot notation.
            const f = require('./func')
        </pre>


        <h2> Q.6-What is the purpose of the module.exports?
        </h2>
        <pre>

            Module.exports is the instruction that tells Node. js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.)
            to “export” from a given file so other files are allowed to access the exported code.
            The module.exports is actually a property of the module object in node.js. module. Exports is the object
            that is returned to the require() call.
            By module.exports, we can export functions, objects, and their references from one file and can use them in
            other files by importing them by require() method. easy to maintain and manage the code base in different modules.
